    This tool is a bit of fun, primarily to show off some nifty word-cloud functionality on a wine-review dataset.

    -   More useful word clouds - beyond just a simple count of the most common words
    -   Interactive map visualising price/score data \n\n

    Building this involved some basic skills from the world of 'Natural Language Processing'; analysing  text data, which is a lot of fun!
